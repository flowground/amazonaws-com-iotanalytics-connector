    "description": "AWS IoT Analytics allows you to collect large amounts of device data, process\nmessages, and store them. You can then query the data and run sophisticated\nanalytics on it. AWS IoT Analytics enables advanced data exploration through\nintegration with Jupyter Notebooks and data visualization through integration\nwith Amazon QuickSight.\n\nTraditional analytics and business intelligence tools are designed to process\nstructured data. IoT data often comes from devices that record noisy processes\n(such as temperature, motion, or sound). As a result the data from these devices\ncan have significant gaps, corrupted messages, and false readings that must be\ncleaned up before analysis can occur. Also, IoT data is often only meaningful in\nthe context of other data from external sources. \n\nAWS IoT Analytics automates the steps required to analyze data from IoT devices.\nAWS IoT Analytics filters, transforms, and enriches IoT data before storing it\nin a time-series data store for analysis. You can set up the service to collect\nonly the data you need from your devices, apply mathematical transforms to\nprocess the data, and enrich the data with device-specific metadata such as\ndevice type and location before storing it. Then, you can analyze your data by\nrunning queries using the built-in SQL query engine, or perform more complex\nanalytics and machine learning inference. AWS IoT Analytics includes pre-built\nmodels for common IoT use cases so you can answer questions like which devices\nare about to fail or which customers are at risk of abandoning their wearable\ndevices.",
